	<p>Chicken</p>
	<p>The history of chickens ( Gallus domesticus ) is <br>still a bit of a puzzle. Scholars <br>agree that they were first domesticated from a <br>wild form called red junglefowl<br> (Gallus gallus), a bird that still runs wild in most of southeast Asia , most likely<br> hybridized with the gray junglefowl (G. sonneratii). <br>That occurred probably about 8,000 years ago.</p>

<div>
	<p>Beef</p>
	<p>Domestication of cattle happened around 8000 BC,<br> and that is when beef consumption<br> really took off. Fast forward to the modern American backyard <br>grill, and try to imagine a world <br>without our favorite red meat (ignoring vegetarians, of course).</p>

	<p>Suchi</p>
	<p>sushi history in japan, sushi history and facts

The history of Sushi began with paddy fields,<br> 
where fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt<br> 
and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The 
dish is today known as narezushi, and was <br>introduced to Japan around the Yayoi period.<br> 
In the Muromachi period, people began to eat the <br>rice as well as the fish. During the Edo period, 
vinegar rather than <br>fermented rice began to be used. In pre-modern
 times and modern <br> times, it has become a form of food<br> strongly associated with Japanese culture.</p>
